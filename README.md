KEEPMESAFE!


KEEPMESAFE! was designed with the sole goal, for people to become more aware of malware and phishing.

The program featuers 3 modes: Website Scanning, File Scanning, Safety Advice

The website and file scanning mode allow for the user to input their website/file and determine whether it's safe or not, along with some advice on what they should do (differs based on how malicious it's seen as). By users learning whether the website/file is safe or not, they're able to make an informed decision based on the results and better protect themselves from being a victim of malware/phishing. The 'Safety Advice' mode gives users more information about malware and phsihing (in an easy-to-understand manner) and helps them become more aware and vigilant of common tactics used by hackers and scammers, which make them less likely to become a victim of these tactics in the future.


To use this program, you will need to install tkinter and customtkinter. This can be done through the command prompt: pip install tkinter     AND pip install customtkinter
